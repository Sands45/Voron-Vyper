CAD adapted from main Voron Switchwire files. It's not perfect for the assembly, but all the individual parts work with the Anycubic Vyper frame and associated parts. You will need to procure all the Switchwire >> Ender conversion parts on your own. My posting this doesn't imply I will support this effort. I've already put in too much effort :)  

Rails - MGN12H:
Two 350mm for the bed
Two 350mm for the Z
One 320mm for the X gantry. 

PSU is Anycubic
The center rail for the structure gets in the way of the control board location, hence the overhang. I used an BTT Ocotpus Pro board. A Fysetc spyder is a bit narrower and will likely fit without the overhang. 

THe panels have cutouts for Nema 17 motors 51mm long. So anything under that will fit. I used 48mm long motors.
The one cooling fan appears to be adaquate for the mainboard. 
The Bed supports work wth Anycubic parts. You may have to shim the bed to level it though. YMMV The Y stop gives full travael and stops *just* short of the rear enclosure panel. 

There are a couple parts that I didn't like but never fixed. The chassis feet mounts tend to warp - really they should have a rail attachement in the middle someplace. I added a screw hole, to drill and tap the frame rail for that purpose. Cable routing to the printer compartment from the electronics could be more elegant, but I just used what was there. i.e, no real provisions for cabient lights, cameras, vent fan wires, etc. 

I have access to a large CNC router, so 1 peice side panels. It would be nice to have screw on side panels vs. VHB attached.
